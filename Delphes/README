This is meant to be a standalone code that can analysis the Delphes samples
for CMS phase 2 upgrade. The codes are based on the examples that come with
Delphes. 

Below is the code structure:

DelMain    -> Main function, getting input from users
|
DelLoop    -> Looping over the TChain
|
DelEvent   -> For each event in the Delphes sample, load a local DelEvent
|  \=> DelEventTT   -> Inherited class for ttbar sample
|  \=> DelEventWino -> Inherited class for SUSY Wino sample
|  \=> DelEventZJJ  -> Inherited class for Z + jets sample
|  \=> DelEventHTB  -> Inherited class for HTbin single boson sample
|  \=> DelEventLL   -> Inherited class for LL sample
|
DelAna     -> Constructed higher level variables based on DelEvent
|
DelProcess -> Split sample into several subprocess output
|
DelCut     -> Each class corresponds to an analysis cutflow
|  \=> DelCutDM     -> Inherited class for VBF SUSY DM search
|  \=> DelCutHiggs  -> Inherited class for Higgs invisiable search

HistTool   -> A tool class for histogram managerment. Used by DelCut
